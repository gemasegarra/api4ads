## API documentation  üìñ

**New feature:**
Authentication via JTW has been implemented to the API. To access apiv1/ads you will need a JWT. 
An user has been created for testing. 

````
email: user@example.com
password: 1234
````

![user token](https://github.com/gemasegarra/api4ads/blob/master/public/images/6.png)

/apiv1/authenticate with POST method will create a token if credentials are valid or return a ```401 Unauthorized``` error if user or password are not valid. This token will be used as a query string to access the API data via /apiv1/ads?token=token.

| Method | Endpoint                    | Response                                             |
|--------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | /apiv1/authenticate         | token to access apiv1/ads if credentials are correct |
| GET    | /apiv1/ads                  | without a valid token, ```401 Unauthorized``` error  |
| GET    | /apiv1/ads?token=validtoken | json data with all ads                               |
| POST   | /apiv1/ads                  | creates a new ad                                     |
| GET    | /apiv1/ads/{ad.id}          | json data of an ad by id                             |
| GET    | /apiv1/tags                 | json data with the allowed tags and the tags in use  |

The API allows to create a new ad using the ```/apiv1/ads``` endpoint with a POST method. 

**New feature!**
Pictures can now be uploaded as a file from your machine and will be saved on public/uploads folder. If ```ads-thumbnails-worker``` is running a thumbnail of the picture with size 100x100 will be created and saved too.

All ads will have the following schema:
````

  name: {  
    type: String, 
    required: [true, 'Ads must have a name'],
    unique: true,
    maxlength: [50, 'Ad names must have less than 50 characters']},

  onSale: {
    type: Boolean,
    required: [true, 'You must specify whether you are looking to sell or looking to buy']
  },
  price: {
    type: Number,
    required: [true, 'Ads must have a price']
  },
  photo: String,
  tags: {
    type: [String],
    enum: ['lifestyle', 'mobile', 'motor', 'work']
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
    maxlength: [100, 'Ad descriptions must have less than 100 characters']
  } 

````  

#### Filtering ads:

The filtering of ads is implemented by using query parameters: 

- Filter ads by name: **?name=*name***
- Filter ads by price: **?price=*number***
- Filter ads by min price: **?price=*-number***
- Filter ads by max price: **?price=*number-***
- Filter ads by min and max price: **?price=*number-number*** i.e ?price=10-20 will return all ads with a price between 10 and 20
- Filter ads by type: **?onSale=*true*** or **?onSale=*false***
- Filter ads by tags: **?tags=*tag***

The API also allows to sort ads, limit the number of shown results (the limit by default is 100 ads) and skip results: 
- Sort ads by name: **?sort=name**
- Sort ads by price: **?sort=price**
- Sort ads by type: **?sort=onSale**
- Sort ads by tags: **?sort=tags**
- Limit results: **?limit=*number***
- Skip results: **?skip=*number***


Examples:

 ```http://localhost:3000/apiv1/ads?name=The%20Outer%20Worlds```  
![result example](https://github.com/gemasegarra/api4ads/blob/master/public/images/1.png)

Several filters can be used at once:

```http://localhost:3000/apiv1/ads?tag=lifestyle&onSale=false``` 

![result example](https://github.com/gemasegarra/api4ads/blob/master/public/images/2.png)


```http://localhost:3000/apiv1/ads?sort=price&onSale=true```
